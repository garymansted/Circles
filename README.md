# Circles
Small app written in Swift 4 for a coding challenge

Release Notes:

Deployment target: iOS 10.0 +

A user can spawn an infinite number of circles by tapping on the main view. 
The newly created circle animates by scaling it's size. 
The circles sizes are calculated randomly between 40 - 100 px.
The circles are filled with random colors obtained from a http request from: www.colourlovers.com/api/colors/random?format=json.
If there is no network connection available or the request fails a random color is generated in code. 
A user can double tap a circle to change its color which is received by the random color generator (see above).
A user can move a circle around the view by tap and dragging it.
A user can pinch zoom to enlarge or shrink a circle.
A user can skake the divice to remove all circles in the view.
No third party libraries have been used.
